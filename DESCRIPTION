Description: Calculates distance-based and volume-overlap-based
        agreement measures for triangular 3D meshes. These include
        the Hausdorff distance, the average surface distance, the
        Dice similarity coefficient, and the Jaccard similarity
        coefficient as documented in Stockinger et al. (2021)
        <doi:10.1186/s13014-021-01965-5>. Overall agreement for
        a set of meshes is calculated as the aggregate agreement
        for all pairwise comparisons. Based on algorithms
        provided by the 'VCGLIB' <http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/vcglib/>
        and 'CGAL' <https://www.cgal.org/> libraries.
        Includes web-based graphical user interface.
