        in convertDVH()

      - add "DHI" for the Homogeneity Index according to
        ICRU 83 formula 3.3: (D2%-D98%) / D50%
    * convertDVH()
      - when converting to differential DVH, interpolate
        cumulative DVH first, not differential DVH afterwards
      - spline interpolation as well as spline and kernel
        smoothing options are moved to convertDVHsmooth()
    * convertDVHsmooth()
      - new function with linear/spline interpolation as well
        as kernel smoothing of the differential DVH

Version 0.3.4 (November 27, 2015)
    * getMeanDVH()
      - new function that returns point-wise aggregates of
        several DVHs, by default the mean, median, standard
        deviation, minimum and maximum of the volumes
    * showDVH()
      - add option addMSD to show the point-wise mean DVH
        as well as shaded areas for point-wise 1-SD and
        2-SD around the mean
    * convertDVH()
      - with toType="asis" and interp="linear", DVHs are
        interpolated with equally spaced dose values
    * getMetric(), showDVH()
      - change default: match supplied IDs and structure names
        exactly to allow for structures containing '+' signs,
        use fixed=FALSE for regular expression matching
    * checkConstraint(), showConstraint()
      - fix bug: make functions work for files not exported
        from Eclipse or Cadplan
      - fix bug: make functions work for DVH files with
        duplicate rows
    * getEUD(), getNTCP(), getTCP()
      - fix bug: version 0.3.1 broke EUD calculation and
        therefore NTCP/TCP calculation

Version 0.3.3 (October 13, 2015)
    * readDVH()
      - add support for RayStation (thanks: Michael R. Young)
      - fix bug: version 0.3.1 broke reading Cadplan files
      - fix bug: correctly convert Cadplan and Monaco
        differential DVHs to cumulative DVHs
        (unlike Eclipse, they are not per unit dose)
      - allow structure names with leading non-alphanumeric
        characters
    * getDMEAN()
      - fix bug: version 0.3.1 broke DMEAN, DMIN, DMAX, DSD for
        DVHs where these metrics were not exported from the TPS
    * convertDVH()
      - fix bug: if option interp was not set, different
        interpolation methods were used for different IDs when
        converting DVHLstLst objects
      - fix bug: correctly scale differential DVH for perDose=FALSE

Version 0.3.1 (August 05, 2015)
    * DESCRIPTION, NAMESPACE
      - import utils and stats to accomodate new R-devel
    * readDVH()
      - add support for Elekta Monaco (thanks: Reid Thompson),
      - add support for Tomo HiArt (thanks: Nico Banz)
      - read Course header entry for Eclipse files
      - add option courseAsID for appending the Course to the
        original patient ID
    * convertDVH()
      - in DVHs objects, a differential DVH is saved to list
        element dvhDiff, a cumulative DVH is saved to list element
        dvh. The original DVH is copied to the other list element,
        respectively.

Version 0.3 (May 5, 2015)
    * getMetric()
      - fix bug: V*% was incorrect
      - increase accuracy for linear and spline interpolation of
        DVHs with few unique nodes

      - fix bug: gEUD calculation based on EQD2

Version 0.2 (April 7, 2015)
    * Shiny web application
      - add settings for gEUD and (N)TCP parameters in metrics
        and constraint
      - exact matching for selected patients and structures
        instead of regex-matching
      - fix bug: selection of patients and structures in 'Show DVH'
      - fix bug: DVHs for different structure sets
    * readDVH()
      - new option 'add' which allows to merge previously loaded data
        with new data read from file (regardless of TPS origin)
      - add support for data exported by Pinnacle3 that conforms to a
        specific directory layout / file structure explained in the docs
        (thanks: Bjorne Riis)
      - fix bug: read first DVH line as well
    * convertDVH()

        with optional spline interpolation / kernel smoothing for the
        differential DVH
    * mergeDV()
      - new function to merge different DVH objects, possibly
        from different treatment planning systems
    * checkConstraint(), getMetric()
      - add DEUD to calculate generalized equivalent uniform dose
        (gEUD), DNTCP to calculate normal tissue complication
        probability (NTCP), and DTCP for tumor control probability (TCP)
      - add option 'interp' to choose DVH interpolation method between
        linear interpolation, a cubic monotone Hermite spline, and
        cubic local polynomial kernel regression
      - now work with artificial DVHs with only two points, possibly
        horizontal or vertical
    * checkConstraint()
      - fix bug: correct projection of constraint point onto line
        segments as affine (not linear) subspaces
    * getMetric()

        standard deviation -> calculate based on the differential DVH

        uniform dose from DVH, DVH list, or DVH list of lists
    * getNTCP()
      - new convenience function to calculate normal tissue complication
        probability from DVH, DVH list, or DVH list of lists according
        to Lyman probit, Niemierko logit, Kaellman Poisson model
    * getTCP()
      - new convenience function to calculate tumor control probability
        from DVH, DVH list, or DVH list of lists
    * getDMEAN()
      - new convencience function to calculate DMEAN, DMEDIAN, DMIN, DMAX,
        DMODE, DSD from the (interpolated) differential DVH instead of
        relying on values exported by the TPS.

    * getEQD2()
