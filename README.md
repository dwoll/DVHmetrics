# DVHmetrics

## Analyze Dose-Volume Histograms and Check Constraints using R

`DVHmetrics` provides functionality for the analysis of dose-volume histograms in radiation oncology:

 * Read dose-volume-histogram (DVH) text files
 * Calculate free DVH metrics, show DVH diagrams
 * Check and visualize quality assurance constraints for the DVH
 * Includes a [`shiny`](http://shiny.rstudio.com/)-based web application for most of the functionality - also available online at [dwoll.shinyapps.io/DVHshiny](http://dwoll.shinyapps.io/DVHshiny/).
 * For further explanations and an example walkthrough, see the [package vignette](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/DVHmetrics/vignettes/DVHmetrics.pdf)
