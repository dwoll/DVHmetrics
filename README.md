# MeshAgreement

Agreement measures for 3D structures saved as mesh files. R package containing an interactive [R](https://www.r-project.org/) [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app. You can upload mesh files (STL, PLY, OBJ, OFF) to generate agreement measures for all pairwise comparisons, as well as the corresponding aggregated agreement. The intended application is to compare delineated structures for radiotherapy treatment planning.

**Currently unstable under heavy development.**

# Implemented agreement measures

 * Pairwise distance-based and volume-overlap-based metrics
     * DCOM: Distance between centers of mass
     * ASD: Average surface distance
     * RMSD: Root mean squared surface distance
     * HD_max: Hausdorff distance - max of both directed HDs
     * HD_avg: Hausdorff distance - average of both directed HDs
     * HD_95:  Hausdorff distance - average of both 95th percentiles of directed surface distances
 * JSC: Jaccard similarity coefficient
 * DSC: Dice similarity coefficient
