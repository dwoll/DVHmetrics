Description: Functionality for analyzing dose-volume histograms (DVH)
        in radiation oncology: Read DVH text files, calculate DVH
        metrics as well as generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD),
        biologically effective dose (BED), equivalent dose in 2 Gy
        fractions (EQD2), normal tissue complication probability
        (NTCP), and tumor control probability (TCP). Show DVH
        diagrams, check and visualize quality assurance constraints
        for the DVH. Includes web-based graphical user interface.
