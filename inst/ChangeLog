DVHMETRICS RELEASE VERSIONS at http://cran.r-project.org/

Version 0.3.1 (August 03, 2015)
    * DESCRIPTION, NAMESPACE
      - changes necessary for current R-devel
    * readDVH()
      - add support for Elekta Monaco (thanks: Reid Thompson),
        and for Tomo HiArt files (thanks: Nico Banz)
      - add option courseAsID for appending the Course to the
        original patient ID. Currently only supported for Eclipse.
    * convertDVH()
      - in DVHs objects, a differential DVH is saved to list
        element dvhDiff, a cumulative DVH is saved to list element
        dvh. The original DVH is copied to the other list element,
        respectively.

Version 0.3 (May 5, 2015)
    * getMetric()
      - fix bug: V*% was incorrect
      - increase accuracy for linear and spline interpolation of
        DVHs with few unique nodes
    * getBED(), getEQD2(), getIsoEffD()
      - add methods to directly convert all doses in (list of) DVHs
    * getEUD()
      - fix bug: gEUD calculation based on EQD2

Version 0.2 (April 7, 2015)
    * Shiny web application
      - add settings for gEUD and (N)TCP parameters in metrics
        and constraint
      - exact matching for selected patients and structures
        instead of regex-matching
      - fix bug: selection of patients and structures in 'Show DVH'
      - fix bug: DVHs for different structure sets
    * readDVH()
      - new option 'add' which allows to merge previously loaded data
        with new data read from file (regardless of TPS origin)
      - add support for data exported by Pinnacle3 that conforms to a
        specific directory layout / file structure explained in the docs
        (thanks: Bjorne Riis)
      - fix bug: read first DVH line as well
    * convertDVH()
      - new function to convert between differential and cumulative DVH
        with optional spline interpolation / kernel smoothing for the
        differential DVH
    * mergeDV()
      - new function to merge different DVH objects, possibly
        from different treatment planning systems
    * checkConstraint(), getMetric()
      - add DEUD to calculate generalized equivalent uniform dose
        (gEUD), DNTCP to calculate normal tissue complication
        probability (NTCP), and DTCP for tumor control probability (TCP)
      - add option 'interp' to choose DVH interpolation method between
        linear interpolation, a cubic monotone Hermite spline, and
        cubic local polynomial kernel regression
      - now work with artificial DVHs with only two points, possibly
        horizontal or vertical
    * checkConstraint()
      - fix bug: correct projection of constraint point onto line
        segments as affine (not linear) subspaces
    * getMetric()
      - if the TPS does not export dose minimum, maximum, mean, median,
        standard deviation -> calculate based on the differential DVH
    * getEUD()
      - new convenience function to calculate generalized equivalent
        uniform dose from DVH, DVH list, or DVH list of lists
    * getNTCP()
      - new convenience function to calculate normal tissue complication
        probability from DVH, DVH list, or DVH list of lists according
        to Lyman probit, Niemierko logit, Kaellman Poisson model
    * getTCP()
      - new convenience function to calculate tumor control probability
        from DVH, DVH list, or DVH list of lists
    * getDMEAN()
      - new convencience function to calculate DMEAN, DMEDIAN, DMIN, DMAX,
        DMODE, DSD from the (interpolated) differential DVH instead of
        relying on values exported by the TPS.
    * getBED()
      - new function for the biologically effective dose (BED)
    * getEQD2()
      - new function for the 2Gy fractions biologically equivalent
        dose (EQD2)
    * getIsoEffD()
      - new function for the isoeffective dose according to the
        linear-quadratic model

Version 0.1 (January 29, 2015)

    * Initial release
