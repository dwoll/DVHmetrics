        interpolated with equally spaced dose values
    * getMetric(), showDVH()
      - change default: match supplied IDs and structure names
        exactly to allow for structures containing '+' signs,

        from Eclipse or Cadplan
      - fix bug: make functions work for DVH files with
        duplicate rows

        (unlike Eclipse, they are not per unit dose)
      - allow structure names with leading non-alphanumeric
        characters
    * getDMEAN()
      - fix bug: version 0.3.1 broke DMEAN, DMIN, DMAX, DSD for
        DVHs where these metrics were not exported from the TPS
    * convertDVH()
      - fix bug: if option interp was not set, different
        interpolation methods were used for different IDs when
        converting DVHLstLst objects
