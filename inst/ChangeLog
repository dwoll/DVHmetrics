DVHMETRICS RELEASE VERSIONS at http://cran.r-project.org/

Version 0.1.0.900 (February 20, 2015)
    * Shiny web application
      - add settings for EUD and (N)TCP parameters in metrics
        and constraint
      - exact matching for selected patients and structures
        instead of regex-matching
      - fix bug with selection of patients and structures in 'Show DVH'
      - fix bug with DVHs for different structure sets
    * readDVH()
      - new option 'add' which allows to merge previously loaded data
        with new data read from file (regardless of TPS origin)
    * convertDVH()
      - new function to convert between differential and cumulative DVH
        with optional spline interpolation / kernel smoothing for the
        differential DVH
    * mergeDV()
      - new function to merge different DVH objects, possibly
        from different treatment planning systems
    * checkConstraint(), getMetric()
      - add DEUD to calculate generalized equivalent uniform dose
        (gEUD), DNTCP to calculate normal tissue complication
        probability (NTCP according to Lyman probit, Niemierko
        logit, Kaellman Poisson model), and DTCP for tumor control
        probability (TCP).
      - add option 'interp' to choose DVH interpolation method between
        linear interpolation, a cubic monotone Hermite spline, and
        cubic local polynomial kernel regression
    * getMetric()
      - add generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD)
      - if the TPS does not export dose minimum, maximum, mean, median,
        standard deviation -> calculate based on the differential DVH
    * getBED()
      - new function for the biologically effective dose (BED)
    * getEQD2()
      - new function for the 2Gy fractions biologically equivalent
        dose (EQD2)
    * getIsoEffD()
      - new function for the isoeffective dose according to the
        linear-quadratic model

Version 0.1 (January 29, 2015)

    * Initial release
